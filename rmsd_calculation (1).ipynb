    "&bull; Loading data into Universe. For this task we use topology file. A topology file can then be followed by any number of trajectory files. A trajectory file contains a list of coordinates in the order defined in the topology. If no trajectory files are given, then only a structure is loaded. If multiple trajectory files are given, the trajectories are concatenated in the given order. MDAnalysis accepts single frames (e.g. PDB, CRD, GRO) and timeseries data (e.g. DCD, XTC, TRR, XYZ).   \n",
