## Project Description  

In this project, I implemented a script to calculate the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) of a molecular dynamics trajectory using the MDAnalysis library in Python. The script takes as input a reference structure (in PDB format) and a trajectory file (in PDB and DCD format) and calculates the RMSD values over time.

To ensure that the script performs efficiently and optimally, I conducted a benchmarking analysis. This analysis involved measuring the execution time of the script using different input files with varying sizes and complexity. I also identified and addressed potential performance bottlenecks in the code, such as inefficient data handling and processing.

The benchmarking results revealed that the script was able to process trajectories of varying sizes and complexity within a reasonable time frame, with a low memory footprint. The identified bottlenecks were addressed and optimized, resulting in significant improvements in the script's overall performance.

Overall, this project demonstrates my skills in Python programming, molecular dynamics analysis, and performance optimization. It also highlights my ability to analyze and address performance bottlenecks in software applications.
